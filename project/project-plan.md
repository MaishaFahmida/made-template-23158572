# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Exploring Climate Change and the Coming Wave of Health Issues

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How do variations in temperature (extreme heat and cold) affect mortality and morbidity rates?
2. Can we identify correlations between climate events (heatwaves, floods) and hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular issues?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
As climate change accelerates, it comes with a host of health challenges, including an increased risk of skin cancer and heat stroke. Higher temperatures intensify UV radiation, increasing the chances of skin cancer. In addition, extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and intense, leading to an increase in heat-related illnesses such as heat shock, dehydration, and heat exhaustion. This change is not just an environmental imperative but an important step in protecting public health from it this emerging threat.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Statistisches Bundesamt
* Metadata URL: https://www.destatis.de/EN/Home/_node.html
* Data URL:https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2022/04/PE22_N018_231.html
* Data Type: CSV

* Data Description:
  Data more than twenty years old, allowing for an understanding of all essential health resources subjected to climate change. Encompassing these findings are precise tables illustrating the rate of dehydration as well as skin cancer, allowing for a case-by-case investigation of the pattern especially in terms of time. The database further comprises data on the incidence of hot days which, by extension, becomes a proxy for the rare occasions of searing heat, and makes correlations between health admissions to the hospitals which helps in understanding the effect of climate-related health risks.

### Datasource2 : FAOSTAT
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home
* Data URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/GT
* Data Type: CSV

* Data Description:
  The database provided by the organization in this report has general data on carbon emissions from 1990 to 2021 and categorized sources from various countries. It covers the world largest sources of CO2 emissions, provides details on what has contributed to emissions over time thus giving an opportunity to understand the trends and fluctuations that have taken place over the past three decades.
