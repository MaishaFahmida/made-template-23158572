## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing Century-Long Global Climate Trends: Air Temperatures and Precipitation Patterns

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1.	How have global air temperatures changed from 1922 to 2021?
2.	What are the observed changes in global precipitation patterns from 1951 to 2021, and how do these changes correlate with the trends in global air temperatures?



## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The goal of this report is to examine trends in global air temperatures for the period of 1922-2021 and explore changes in global precipitation rates from 1951-2021. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the long-term patterns and anomalies in these critical climate variables.  Additionally, the report will explore the relationship between temperature and precipitation, examining how shifts in one may influence the other. Understanding these interconnections is vital for predicting future climate scenarios and their potential impacts. 

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: 
* Metadata URL: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/monthly/qc/air_temperature_mean/
* Data URL:https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/monthly/qc/air_temperature_mean/historical/01001_192201_202112.txt
* Data Type: txt

* Data Description:
  Specifically, this dataset identifies monthly global air temperature anomalies from the period of 1922 through 2021. Anomalies are concrete deviations from 
  long-term average temperature thus giving a true picture of temperatures rising or falling with time.

### Datasource2 : 
* Metadata URL: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/monthly/qc/precipitation_total/historical/
* Data URL: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/monthly/qc/precipitation_total/historical/01001_195101_202112.txt
* Data Type: txt

* Data Description:
  The source data includes monthly precipitation for the years between 1951 and 2020. One obvious characteristic is that it contains information on 
  precipitation occurrence for 70 years, which makes it possible to assess the tendencies in climatic changes.
